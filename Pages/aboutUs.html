                        Celebrate multiculturalism was established in 1982, and has been running an annual international food festival in Point Pleasant Park ever since.  The international food festival is especially fitting for the Halifax Regional Municipality – owing to the numerous ethnicities that make up Halifax’s population – and always draws a large crowd.  Last year, 30 000 Halgonians visited our “Bahamas Mama” festival between August 5th and 9th; our largest crowd yet.  This year, we are hoping to draw even larger numbers with our cultural focus on New Zealand.  Our theme will be “I’ve been Kiwied!” and the festival will feature eight traditional New Zealand recipes, ten New Zealand bands (from folk music to rock music) and a number displays featuring traditional artwork and crafts. This, of course, will be in addition to the hundreds of other food exhibits, art displays and musical/dance acts that we already have lined up for the festival. Our chairperson, Chloe Malone, is excited about this year’s festival: she believes that this year’s festival will be our most successful yet.  Let’s pray for good weather &#128512;
